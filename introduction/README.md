# Introduction to JavaScript

## What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a versatile programming language known for its role in web development, but it's also used in various non-browser environments. It enables dynamic content on web pages, which makes it an indispensable tool for modern web applications.

> "JavaScript was introduced in 1995 as a way to add programs to web pages in the Netscape Navigator browser. It has since been adopted by all other major graphical web browsers." - Marijn Haverbeke, *Eloquent JavaScript*

## Why Learn JavaScript?
Learning JavaScript opens up numerous possibilities in both front-end and back-end development. It's a language that supports both functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, making it highly flexible and adaptable.

> "JavaScript is built into almost every web browser and is thus available on just about every device." - Marijn Haverbeke, *Eloquent JavaScript*

## History of JavaScript
Created by Brendan Eich in 1995, JavaScript has grown significantly from a scripting tool to a robust language used in complex applications across platforms.

> "The language has made modern web applications possibleâ€”applications with which you can interact directly, without doing a page reload for every action." - Marijn Haverbeke, *Eloquent JavaScript*

## How JavaScript Works
JavaScript can be embedded directly into HTML, executed client-side by the browser, enhancing the user experience without the need for server-side computation.

> "This book intends to make you familiar enough with this language to be able to make a computer do what you want." - Marijn Haverbeke, *Eloquent JavaScript*
